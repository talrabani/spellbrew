# FSRS Implementation Summary

## Overview

The Spellbrew Hebrew learning game has been successfully upgraded from a simple +/- scoring system to a sophisticated **FSRS (Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler)** algorithm. This implementation provides scientifically-backed spaced repetition that adapts to each user's learning patterns.

## What Was Changed

### 1. Database Schema Updates (`server/db/schema.sql`)

**Removed:**
- `learned_score` column (simple integer scoring)

**Added:**
- `fsrs_stability` (DECIMAL) - How well the word is learned (increases with successful reviews)
- `fsrs_difficulty` (DECIMAL) - How hard the word is for the user (personalized)
- `fsrs_retrievability` (DECIMAL) - Current likelihood of remembering (0-1 scale)
- `fsrs_last_review` (TIMESTAMP) - When the word was last reviewed
- `fsrs_next_review` (TIMESTAMP) - When the word should be reviewed next
- `fsrs_review_count` (INTEGER) - Total number of reviews

**Updated indexes** for optimal FSRS query performance.

### 2. FSRS Algorithm Module (`server/fsrs.js`)

Created a dedicated module implementing the core FSRS functions:

- **`calculateNextInterval()`** - Determines when to review next based on stability
- **`calculateRetrievability()`** - Calculates current memory strength
- **`gameResultToRating()`** - Maps game results to FSRS ratings (1-4)
- **`updateFSRSParameters()`** - Updates stability and difficulty based on performance
- **`calculateProgressPercentage()`** - Converts FSRS data to user-friendly progress %
- **`getLearningStatus()`** - Determines learning stage (new/learning/reviewing/mastered)

### 3. Server API Updates (`server/server.js`)

**Enhanced `upsertUserVocabProgress()` function:**
- Now handles all FSRS parameters
- Supports complex progress tracking with timestamps

**Updated word selection (`/api/words/user`):**
- Prioritizes words by retrievability (lowest first)
- Considers review count and difficulty
- Automatically adds new words when needed
- Respects next review timestamps

**Enhanced progress recording (`/api/progress/batch`):**
- Calculates current retrievability before each review
- Maps game results to FSRS ratings
- Updates stability and difficulty dynamically
- Calculates optimal next review intervals

**Updated progress endpoints:**
- `/api/progress` - Returns FSRS data with calculated progress percentages
- `/api/progress/list` - Supports sorting by FSRS parameters
- `/api/progress/ensure` - Uses stability thresholds instead of learned_score

### 4. Frontend Updates

**VocabReviewPage (`client/src/components/vocab/VocabReviewPage.jsx`):**
- **New statistics**: Mastered, Reviewing, Learning, New (instead of just Learned/In Progress)
- **Enhanced sorting options**: Stability, Difficulty, Retrievability, Reviews, Next Review
- **New filtering options**: Learning, Reviewing, Mastered (instead of Learning/Learned)
- **Detailed hover information**: Shows FSRS parameters, next review dates, progress percentages
- **Progress visualization**: Color-coded by learning status with percentage display

**GamePage (`client/src/components/game/GamePage.jsx`):**
- **Added progress tracking**: Records all game results for FSRS processing
- **Automatic progress submission**: Sends results to FSRS algorithm when game ends
- **Enhanced state management**: Tracks game results throughout the session

## How FSRS Works in the Game

### 1. Word Selection Algorithm
Words are selected based on:
1. **Retrievability** (lowest first) - Words you're most likely to forget
2. **Review count** (lowest first) - New words get priority
3. **Error count** (highest first) - Struggling words get more attention
4. **Word rank** (lowest first) - Common words first

### 2. Progress Calculation
When you answer correctly/incorrectly:
1. **Calculate current retrievability** based on time since last review
2. **Map game result to FSRS rating**:
   - Correct + low retrievability = "Easy" (rating 4)
   - Correct + medium retrievability = "Good" (rating 3)
   - Correct + high retrievability = "Hard" (rating 2)
   - Incorrect = "Again" (rating 1)
3. **Update stability and difficulty** based on rating
4. **Calculate next review interval** using FSRS formula

### 3. Learning Stages
- **New** (0 reviews): Just introduced
- **Learning** (stability < 1): Still being learned
- **Reviewing** (stability 1-5): In spaced repetition
- **Mastered** (stability â‰¥ 5): Well learned, long intervals

### 4. Progress Visualization
Progress percentage combines:
- **Stability factor** (50% weight) - How well learned
- **Review factor** (30% weight) - How much practice
- **Difficulty factor** (20% weight) - How challenging

## Benefits of FSRS Implementation

### 1. **Scientifically Proven**
- Based on memory research and forgetting curves
- Optimized through machine learning algorithms
- More effective than simple spaced repetition

### 2. **Personalized Learning**
- Adapts to each user's learning patterns
- Tracks individual word difficulty
- Optimizes review intervals per user

### 3. **Efficient Study**
- Minimizes total study time
- Maximizes long-term retention
- Prioritizes words that need attention

### 4. **Predictable Progress**
- Clear learning stages
- Transparent progress tracking
- Reliable review schedules

### 5. **Scalable System**
- Works with large vocabularies
- Maintains performance with many users
- Easy to tune and optimize
